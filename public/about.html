<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my profile! I am a recent new grad from the University of Toronto. After 5 gruellling and tough
  years pursuing a computer science degree, I have finally graduated only to find out...the software industry is completely
  saturated, mass layoffs are happening EVERYWHERE (yes! Even the big tech companies! insanity!), and all entry-level/junior positions
  are overfilled with mid-senior developer applicants. The stars are definitely not in my favour! I sobbed! I bawled! I cried! I panicked!
  But no! 2024 is the year of the dragon, NOT the crybaby! And so, here I am trying to review and learn some new skills, and catch myself
  up on the current industry standards-- starting with web development, leading to the creation of this website. In the coming weeks, expect
  this website to grow, morph, and transform as I continue to learn new frontend technologies and develop my eye for design.
</p>

<p>My background is in automation development, as given by my prior internship experience. I would be qualified for any entry-level 
  position as a Test Automation Developer, QA Engineer, or even as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET as coined by 
  Microsoft). I also have a background in ML. During my final years of undergrad I took several courses within the realm of AI such as
  Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and I've even enlisted myself in two different research experiences-- one
  in computational chemistry working with Genetic AI, and the other in computer vision working on out-of-distribution detection (OOD).
</p>

<p>My tech journey doesn't stop at ML! My skillset and interests are constantly morphing and changing. Currently I've taken
  a liking to learn more about project management, and also game development. For fun, I enjoy writing stories, jamming on the guitar,
  and snowboarding.
</p>

<p>
  If you've made it this far-- wow! You must be in love with me or something (just kidding)! Thank you for reading, and I hope you're
  as pumped as I am to see how this portfolio of mine expands in the coming future.
</p>

In thanks of visiting my website, here's a reward- a picture of my dog, Twinkie!
